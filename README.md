## The most impatient batch anime download links generator

## Inspiration
I found myself searching through countless sites to download quality anime in batch which weren't blocked by my ISP or my college firewall and when i find one, each episode link leads to an ad which makes me wait x seconds and then give me the real link. So here's what of an impatient programer did for the next two days.

- Found a really great site which provides quality anime links after scrolling through  reddit! :heart: (But the site had the whole one file - one advert thing, so...)
- Found their API endpoints (kinda), Well they weren't really API when i started but when i got through with them they were faster, lighter, and easier to parse for all my purposed intended and yeah i overcame the advert with some common sense.
- Okay so how i made the API was to scrape the endpoint and create my very own json feed which worked like a charm.
- Then just create a menu driven program using the json to create txt files with download links.
